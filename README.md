# CanningGarbageDump
A silly website project put together in a few hours for ICTWEB450 (Certificate IV in Information Technology).

This joke of a "project" had been completed way back in mid-late 2021, but I've only got around to uploading it now. It can be improved in several ways though this is what has been produced under the time constraint of a few hours.

Flask and Python are used, along with fpdf to generate a receipt. SQLite is also used to store orders/users but there has not been any use of this so far.

This project is not associated with the City of Canning in any way, shape, or form.
